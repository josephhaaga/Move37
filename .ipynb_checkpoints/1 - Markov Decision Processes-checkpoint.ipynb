    "**Reinforcement Learning** is a machine learning technique exhibiting characteristics of both supervised and unsupervised learning. Labels (a.k.a _rewards_ or _y_ outputs) are sparse and time-delayed, and the consequences of an agent's actions are not guaranteed to be immediately observable. Current solutions involve the combination of pattern recognition networks, and realtime environment learning frameworks (deep reinforcement learning)."

    "An online product delivery startup provides logistical analytics to determine the best delivery route for a product. This dynamic problem is an ideal candidate for reinforcement learning, requiring a learning system that is adaptive to changes. Furthermore, there is no existing dataset to learn from, and learning must be done in _real time_ (time bering a new dimension when compared to traditional supervised learning). "
